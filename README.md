# Goal

## Budget

The main focus here is to understand, based on my account statements (.xlsx):
- how much I spend in each category
- how much I save and invest
- determine whether my budget allows me to clear a budget surplus or if I should increase/shift it towards another category
- identify the flaws in my budget (i.e. negative amount of cashflow, irregular saving patterns and amounts)

## Consumption Habits

Grocery shopping is a massive area of expenditure, right ?

Knowing so, wouldn't it be interesting to be able to understand my (me and my family) consumption habits in even more details than just my account statements ?

Well, my local supermarket allows me to do just that by mailing me my invoices (.pdf).
