## Context and Overview
This report demonstrates Business Intelligence and leverages the insights digged out from my own account statements and hypermarket invoices using a Power BI dashboard.

It provides a detailed analysis of my budget expenditure for 2023 and 2024, considering the impact of inflation and price variations in key sectors such as food, housing, and child-related expenses. The [objective](../README.md#goal) is to highlight trends, identify budgetary challenges, and offer strategic recommendations to optimize financial management in 2024.

## Key Findings

1. **General Decrease in Expenses (2024 vs. 2023)**:
   - **Total expenses decreased by 30%** compared to 2023. This reduction is partly due to better budgeting and a more cautious approach to non-essential spending. However, this decrease did not fully balance the cash flow.
   - **Cash outflow exceeded cash inflow by 10%**, primarily due to **significant expenses for 2024 summer vacation** (airfare and hotels in the US are quite expensive...). These vacation-related expenses significantly cut into my annual budget surplus, which was originally estimated at an average €520.

2. **Summer Vacation 2024: Major Impact**:
   - I observed a **cash inflow peak at the start of 2024** related to the preparation for the summer vacation, but this was insufficient to cover the higher-than-expected expenses. This imbalance between inflows and outflows created a financial strain which'll have to be monitored for the rest of the year.

3. **Underestimated Child Budget Despite Inflation**:
   - Although our child budget was **increased by 9% in February 2024** to account for inflation, **actual costs exceeded the provision**. Data indicates a **significant rise in child-related expenses**, particularly childcare fees and the cost of infant products.
   - The **38% increase in dairy prices** heavily impacted the **cost of infant formula** and is directly linked, at least partially, to this rise.

4. **Housing Budget was Accurately Estimated**:
   - We seem to have a **well-adjusted housing budget** to reflect inflation (23% on household products). The **budget surplus** for this category is comparable to or slightly higher than 2023, indicating effective management of this expense.

5. **Food Expenses: Significant Increase in Average Spending**:
   - **Food expenses increased by 28%**, which can be attributed to several factors:
     - An increase in purchasing **organic and higher-quality products** (up 29% for these items).
     - **Widespread inflation** on dairy (+38%), meat (+32%), fruits and vegetables (+22%), and children's products (+18%).
   - As a consequence of this shift in consumption towards more expensive products, **average weekly grocery basket increased** to €121 and a monthly €544.

6. **Inflation Effects**:
   - **Inflation impacted each product category differently**. For example, items such as **ground beef (+44.67%)**, **butter (+42.42%)**, and **scarmoza cheese (+50.72%)** saw dramatic price increases. Inflation peaked at the start of 2024, with a decline starting in June.
   
   For me, the feeling of total decorrelation between inflation rates and consumer price indexes advertised by media and government communication was justified, as it is way higher.
   
   >**Please be careful** when you hear about prices falling : as an example, butter prices at my local hypermarket rose by 40% before falling by only 8%.

## Identified Challenges

1. **Budgetary Imbalance**:
   - Cash outflow exceeded cash inflow, exacerbated by discretionary expenses (summer vacation). This deficit poses a risk to financial stability in the medium term, though it was planned.
   
2. **Underestimation of Child Budget**:
   - Our budget forecasts for child-related expenses did not fully account for inflation and rising costs. The adjustments made in February 2024 were insufficient to contain these costs.

3. **Inflation Not Uniformly Integrated**:
   - Inflation on food expenses, especially organic and dairy products, was not fully anticipated, contributing to the overspending in the food budget. The shift to higher-quality products further amplified this impact.

## Strategic Actions

1. **Rebalance Cash Flow**:
   - **Reduce non-essential expenses**, particularly large discretionary purchases (vacations, luxury items) to align cash inflows and outflows.
   - **Reallocate the annual budget surplus** towards critical categories (children, food) to avoid prolonged deficits or indebtedness.

2. **Revise Child Budget**:
   - It is crucial to **increase the budget provision for child-related expenses**, accounting for inflation in essential products (e.g. milk). I may proceed to **Quarterly budget reviews** to adjust expenses more accurately.

3. **Optimize Food Expenses**:
   - **Meal planning** had disappeared because our tupperwares would not air seal anymore. It may be time to invest in a new one to optimize grocery shopping and to help mitigate the impact of inflation.
   - Encourage **diversifying purchasing sources** (local markets, food waste reduction apps) to limit the rising costs at supermarkets.

4. **Inflation Management**:
   - Monitor inflation trends more closely, particularly on highly volatile products (meat, dairy), and incorporate these fluctuations into a **more flexible budget** for 2025.
   - Implement a **detailed tracking system for inflation-impacted categories** by monitoring prices and setting up alerts with Power BI Service or Power Automate, allowing for better anticipation of necessary adjustments.


## Conclusion

2024 presents significant budgetary challenges, mainly due to inflation in food prices and child-related expenses. Despite a 30% reduction in overall spending, the imbalance between cash inflows and outflows remains concerning, but is mostly due to summer vacation expenses.

I plan to rebalance the budget, prioritize critical expenses, and adopt a more flexible strategy in response to inflation to achieve optimal financial stability.
