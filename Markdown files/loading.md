# Loading

- [Go back to ETL](ETL.md)
- [Go back to Tranformation](transformation.md)
- [Go back to Extraction](extraction.md)

# Good Practices

There actually isn't much to say here. Just remember to :

- **Not load tables without transforming it** unless you're 100% sure of where it comes from
- **Disable loading of helper queries** and other tables that are not relevant to the semantic model


# Next Step
